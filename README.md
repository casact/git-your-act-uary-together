# Welcome

We are calling all actuaries that are interested in learning about git (and GitHub), but might not have the technical background just yet. Is that you? Well you came to the right place.

## Sign Your Name

You are welcome to practice your git skills by signing your name in the autographs.md file. Feel free to just sign your name, tell a joke, or leave a message at the bottom of the file. You'll then need to make a pull request so we can review the changes before they are merged here. The only rules are that your message is a single line long, and you add it to the end of the file. 

## What else is this Repo for?

We don't know yet. What are your ideas?
